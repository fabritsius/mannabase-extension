With this extension you can:

(All changes above are optional).

Set custom avatar and message in the extension options (press on extension icon to see them).

### Unwanted software
This extension is unpacked and not registered in the Chrome Web Store. That means it should be marked as **unwanted software**. Please read [this article on this topic](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/external_extensions) for more.

I have no bad intension but I suggest you check the code by yourself.

### TODOs
